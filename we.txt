Questions and notes : 
1) Does your company use snapshot testing
2) 

1) Very difficult to install mocha-chai-enzyme tesitng environment - dependecy tree breaks down
2) Enzyme .simulate('submit') does not work for now src: `https://github.com/enzymejs/enzyme/blob/master/docs/future.md`
3) Async funtions throw an error when tested, due to problem with babel config
4) For now connect() function also can't be tested because can not install 'react-redux' library
